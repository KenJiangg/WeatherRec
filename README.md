# WeatherRec 
Built a web application that tracks weather for multiple locations and recommends clothing based on weather. Uses Open Cage API and Dark Sky API to search location and find weather. Some additions I am adding on currently is adding a map feature using Leaflet.js and potentially graphs through python(matplotlib/seaborn) or javascript(D3.js)
